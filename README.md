# Electric Vehicles Data Generation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that generates electric vehicles data based on real data. Each object in the generated data includes information about the vehicle, user, and log.

## Notebook

The main component of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook file named `data_generation.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code and documentation for generating the electric vehicles data. You can open and run the notebook to generate the data or explore the code and analysis.

## Data Generation

The data generation process utilizes real data as the basis for creating the electric vehicles dataset. The generated data includes information such as vehicle details (e.g., make, model, year), user information (e.g., name, contact details), and log information (e.g., maintenance records, usage statistics).

## Usage

To use the Jupyter Notebook and generate the electric vehicles data, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, if any, as mentioned in the notebook.
3. Open the `data_generation.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and generate the electric vehicles data.
5. Explore the generated data and utilize it for your specific use case or analysis.
